# Frontend Design Challenge: Autocomplete Search Component

## Objective

Design and implement a reusable autocomplete search component in React.

## Core Requirements

1. Create an input field that accepts user queries
2. Fetch and display search results as the user types
3. Allow selection of search results
4. Styling the component is not necessary

<!-- ## Additional Considerations
- Limiting API calls
- Asynchronous data fetching
- Keyboard navigation for search results
- Error handling and loading states
- Accessibility
- Performance optimization
- Styling
-->

## API

Use the this API for mock data:
`https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users?name_like=${query}`.

This will return a list of users, filtered by their names.

## Time

You have 45 minutes to work on this challenge. Focus on core functionality first. If time permits, we'll add more considerations.

## Evaluation Criteria

- Code organization and clarity
- User experience considerations
- Discussion of trade-offs and potential improvements

<!-- - React best practices and hooks usage
- Handling of asynchronous operations -->

Feel free to ask any clarifying questions before you begin. Good luck!

`yarn start` to run app.
